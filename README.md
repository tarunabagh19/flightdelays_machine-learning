üõ´ Flight Delays Prediction (Using Machine Learning)
A deep learning project designed to predict flight delays using historical flight records and weather data. It leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to learn temporal patterns and essential flight characteristics that influence delay outcomes.

üìå Project Overview
This repository illustrates how to forecast flight delays by modeling past flight sequences and environmental inputs. The RNN model learns from features such as carrier code, origin/destination airports, scheduling time, distance, and weather indicators to estimate the likelihood or magnitude of delays.

This project is based on an example shared in a GitHub notebook under the repository tarunabagh19/flightdelays_machine-learning discussed on Stack Overflow

‚ú® Main Features
Temporal Sequence Modeling: Captures delay patterns over time with RNNs.

Feature Engineering: Uses flight and weather data such as airline, airports, schedule, distance, and delay history.

Evaluation: Supports classification or regression with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error.

üß≠ Workflow Overview
Data Preparation ‚Äì Clean, merge, encode, and normalize features including delay and weather signals.

Model Training ‚Äì Use notebooks or scripts to train RNNs on historical flight sequences.

Evaluation ‚Äì Visualize performance via metrics, training curves, confusion matrices, or ROC/F1 plots.

Prediction ‚Äì Apply the trained model to new flight data to forecast delays.
