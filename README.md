Flight Delays Prediction Using Machine Learning ✈️
A machine learning project that predicts flight delays using flight history and weather data. Core to the approach is leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model temporal patterns and key flight attributes.

Overview
This repository demonstrates how deep learning can forecast flight delays by modeling sequences of past flight data and associated features. By combining flight and weather information, it aims to anticipate disruptions before they happen.

Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Then clone the repository and install dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/tarunabagh19/flightdelays_machine-learning.git
cd flightdelays_machine-learning

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Key Features
Temporal Modeling: Utilizes RNNs to capture delay patterns over sequences of flights.

Feature Engineering: Includes attributes like airline carrier, airports, scheduled times, distance, and weather-related variables.

Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score, or mean squared error (depending on regression or classification setup).

Step-by-Step Process
Prepare the data — Clean, merge, encode, and scale features.

Train the model — Use provided scripts or notebooks to train your RNN on historical flight sequences.

Evaluate performance — Visualize results using metrics like loss curves, confusion matrices, ROC/F1 scores, or error distributions.

Make predictions — Run trained model on new data to forecast delays.

Dependencies
Your project requires the following Python packages:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

These support working with data, training models, visualizing results, and scaling features. All remaining imports like re, datetime, and math are part of Python’s standard library.

Additional Insight
This project is based on real-world experimentation where combining datasets and using deep learning led to more accurate delay forecasting. Together, the flight data and weather context make predictions smarter and more responsive.

Extend and Improve
Here are a few ways you could build upon this:

Replace RNNs with LSTM or GRU networks to capture longer time dependencies.

Add more features like airport congestion, flight connections, or weather forecasts.

Experiment with alternative models such as Random Forests, XGBoost, or ensemble approaches.
